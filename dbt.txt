Rise of Modern Data Stack

SMP
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) is a computer processing method that involves multiple processors sharing a single operating system and memory. 
In SMP, processors share the same input/output (I/O) bus or data path.

MPP cloud Data storage: Massive Parallel Processing
Eg: snowflake, Google big query, Amazon Redshift Managed Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pool.
compute and storage are decoupled.


Row oriented databases --> Column oriented databases

ROB -> Read and Write Easy eg: Postgres, MySQL
Column oriented databases --> Analytics, Compressed, Less I/O
