Rise of Modern Data Stack

SMP
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) is a computer processing method that involves multiple processors sharing a single operating system and memory. 
In SMP, processors share the same input/output (I/O) bus or data path.

MPP cloud Data storage: Massive Parallel Processing
Eg: snowflake, Google big query, Amazon Redshift Managed Storage, Azure Synapse Analytics SQL pool.
compute and storage are decoupled.


Row oriented databases --> Column oriented databases

ROB -> Read and Write Easy eg: Postgres, MySQL
Column oriented databases --> Analytics, Compressed, Less I/O

Main requirements for data engineers:

Model Changes are easy to follow and revert
Explicit dependencies between the models
Data Quality test
Error reporting
Incremental load of fact tables
Track history of dimensional changes tables
Easy to access documentation
